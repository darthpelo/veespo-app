## Introduction

I create this application to show how simple is include Veespo Framework in your Xcode project.
With this application you can now express your opinion on everything with a Veespo Category Code in seconds. 
Insert the Veespo Category Code and your name in the app home screen and you can immediately start to give feedback. 

With veespo-app you can: 
- express your opinion on everything with a Category Code around you 
- rate venues and places nearby and see what other people think. 
- give feedback on the last tech and soccer news

You can find the application on [AppStore](https://itunes.apple.com/nz/app/veespo-lite/id785507111?mt=8).

## How to use

This project show only the code to implement and use Veespo Framework, the framework isn't present in the prokect. To have it, you can contat me at info@veespo.com

Moreover, in this project I use **Foursquare** API, so you need to regist yourself like developer to use it and put Foursquare key and secret in a file named **Veespo-Keys.plist** (this file isn't present in the project, you can *"find"* it in gitignore).
