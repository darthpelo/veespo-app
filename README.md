## How to use

This project show only the code to implement and use Veespo Framework, the framework isn't present in the prokect. To have it, you can contat me at info@veespo.com

Moreover, in this project I use **Foursquare** API, so you need to regist yourself like developer to use it and put Foursquare key and secret in a file named **Veespo-Keys.plist** (this file isn't present in the project, you can *"find"* it in gitignore).
